# Mapperdom
A work-in-progress Mapping engine for the Universal Windows Platform

## What is Mapping?
"Mapping", also known as "fictional videomapping", is a genre of animated map videos meant to tell a story, wherein each country is personified and "talks" to one another, while having their own stories, goals, diplomatic relationships, and wars.
