# Mapperdom
Mapping engine

Archived due to shifting priorities. While many may have seen my content on YouTube and in the mapping community working on newer features, these features are sadly NOT in this repository, and have since been lost!
The project also suffered from technical challenges, especially performance, as multiple bigmap layers were used with poor algorithms. If I or anyonde else were to remake this project, it would likely be in a lower-level language, and utilize frameworks that did not rely on redrawing and reloading entire images, and would hopefully be done with better data structures and faster algorithms. I've learned a lot since this time, and I did make some of those changes. But alas, it wasn't it.

Thank you all for your support with this experiment ðŸ˜Š
